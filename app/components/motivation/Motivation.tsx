By reusing rotor blades, rethink*rotor reduces raw material consumption and waste, giving these components a sustainable second life in architecture. Their unique shape and material properties make them a valuable asset for innovative applications in construction.",

          WHY it is good for the environment
        </h1>
        <p className="text-textColor text-sm sm:text-md mt-2">
          The European Union aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 through its
          "European Green Deal." This transformation to a circular economy poses
          challenges for the fiber composite industry. Demand for lightweight
          materials, especially in wind energy, is growing, but recycling
          composites like epoxy resin FRPs remains difficult and unsustainable with
          current methods like pyrolysis or shredding.
        </p>
        <p className="text-textColor text-sm sm:text-md mt-2">
          By 2025, around 80,000 tons of end-of-life composite materials are
          expected annually, including 7,500 discarded rotor blades in Germany
          alone. Current disposal methods, such as shredding or thermal recycling
          in cement production, are neither COâ‚‚-neutral nor sustainable, highlighting
          the urgent need for innovative solutions.
